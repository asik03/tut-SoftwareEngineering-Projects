# RefactoringMiner
RefactoringMiner is a library/API written in Java that can detect refactorings applied in the history of a Java project.

Currently, it supports the detection of the following refactorings:

1. Extract Method
2. Inline Method
3. Rename Method
4. Move Method/Attribute
5. Pull Up Method/Attribute
6. Push Down Method/Attribute
7. Extract Class/Subclass/Superclass/Interface
8. Move Class
9. Rename Class
10. Move and Rename Class
11. Extract and Move Method
12. Move Source Folder
13. Change Package (Move, Rename, Split, Merge)
14. Extract Variable
15. Inline Variable
16. Parameterize Variable
17. Rename Variable/Parameter
18. Rename Attribute
19. Move and Rename Attribute
20. Replace Variable with Attribute
21. Replace Attribute (with Attribute)

In order to build the project, run `./gradlew jar` (or `gradlew jar`, in Windows) in the project's root directory.
Alternatively, you can generate a complete distribution zip including all runtime dependencies running `./gradlew distZip`.

You can also work with the project with Eclipse IDE. First, run `./gradlew eclipse` to generate Eclipse project metadata files. Then, import it into Eclipse using the *Import Existing Project* feature.

## API usage guidelines ##

RefactoringMiner can automatically detect refactorings in the entire history of 
git repositories, between specified commits or tags, or at specified commits.

In the code snippet below we demonstrate how to print all refactorings performed
in the toy project https://github.com/danilofes/refactoring-toy-example.git.

```java
GitService gitService = new GitServiceImpl();
GitHistoryRefactoringMiner miner = new GitHistoryRefactoringMinerImpl();

Repository repo = gitService.cloneIfNotExists(
    "tmp/refactoring-toy-example",
    "https://github.com/danilofes/refactoring-toy-example.git");

miner.detectAll(repo, "master", new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(RevCommit commitData, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitData.getId().getName());
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
});
```

You can also analyze between commits using `detectBetweenCommits` or between tags using `detectBetweenTags`. RefactoringMiner will start from commit or tag as specified and iterate backwards. If the end commit or end tag is not specified, RefactoringMiner will detect until the first beginning.

```java
miner.detectBetweenCommits(repo, 
    "d4bce13a443cf12da40a77c16c1e591f4f985b47", "dde3ef036bdddae550c4e98373db4c81d77b5043",
    new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(RevCommit commitData, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitData.getId().getName());
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
});
```

```java
miner.detectBetweenTags(repo, "1.1", "1.0", new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(RevCommit commitData, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitData.getId().getName());
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
});
```

It is possible to analyze a specifc commit using `detectAtCommit` instead of `detectAll`. The commit
is identified by its SHA key, such as in the example below:

```java
miner.detectAtCommit(repo, "https://github.com/danilofes/refactoring-toy-example.git",
    "05c1e773878bbacae64112f70964f4f2f7944398", new RefactoringHandler() {
  @Override
  public void handle(RevCommit commitData, List<Refactoring> refactorings) {
    System.out.println("Refactorings at " + commitData.getId().getName());
    for (Refactoring ref : refactorings) {
      System.out.println(ref.toString());
    }
  }
});
```
You can get the churn of a specific commit using `churnAtCommit` as follows:
```java
Churn churn = miner.churnAtCommit(repo, "05c1e773878bbacae64112f70964f4f2f7944398", handler);
```

There is also a lower level API that works comparing the source code from two
folders that contain the code before and after the code changes:  

```java
// Assuming you have a List<String> of the changed/added/removed file paths from version1 to version2
// filename format example: /src/gr/uom/java/xmi/UMLModelASTReader.java

File rootFolder1 = new File("/path/to/version1/");
File rootFolder2 = new File("/path/to/version2/");
List<String> filePaths1 = new ArrayList<String>();
filePaths1.add("/src/package/Foo.java");
List<String> filePaths2 = new ArrayList<String>();
filePaths2.add("/src/package/Foo.java");

UMLModel model1 = new UMLModelASTReader(rootFolder1, filePaths1).getUmlModel();
UMLModel model2 = new UMLModelASTReader(rootFolder2, filePaths2).getUmlModel();
UMLModelDiff modelDiff = model1.diff(model2);
List<Refactoring> refactorings = modelDiff.getRefactorings();
```

Note that by doing this you may get different results from the git history analysis, because
the latter uses information from git to better identify moves and renames.

## Location information for the detected refactorings ##
All classes implementing the `Refactoring` interface include refactoring-specific location information.
For example, `ExtractOperationRefactoring` offers the following methods:

1. `getSourceOperationCodeRangeBeforeExtraction()` : Returns the code range of the source method in the **parent** commit
2. `getSourceOperationCodeRangeAfterExtraction()` : Returns the code range of the source method in the **child** commit
3. `getExtractedOperationCodeRange()` : Returns the code range of the extracted method in the **child** commit
4. `getExtractedCodeRangeFromSourceOperation()` : Returns the code range of the extracted code fragment from the source method in the **parent** commit
5. `getExtractedCodeRangeToExtractedOperation()` : Returns the code range of the extracted code fragment to the extracted method in the **child** commit
6. `getExtractedOperationInvocationCodeRange()` : Returns the code range of the invocation to the extracted method inside the source method in the **child** commit

Each method returns a `CodeRange` object including the following properties:
```java
String filePath
int startLine
int endLine
int startColumn
int endColumn
```

## Running from the command line ##

When you build a distributable application with `./gradlew distZip`, you can run Refactoring Miner as a command line application. Extract the file under `build/distribution/RefactoringMiner.zip` in the desired location, and cd into the `bin` folder (or include it in your path). Then, run `RefactoringMiner -h` to show its usage:

    > RefactoringMiner -h

	-h															Show tips
	-a <git-repo-folder> <branch>								Detect all refactorings at <branch> for <git-repo-folder>. If <branch> is not specified, commits from all branches are analyzed.
	-bc <git-repo-folder> <start-commit-sha1> <end-commit-sha1>	Detect refactorings Between <star-commit-sha1> and <end-commit-sha1> for project <git-repo-folder>
	-bt <git-repo-folder> <start-tag> <end-tag>					Detect refactorings Between <start-tag> and <end-tag> for project <git-repo-folder>
	-c <git-repo-folder> <commit-sha1>							Detect refactorings at specified commit <commit-sha1> for project <git-repo-folder>
	
For example, suppose that you run:

    > git clone https://github.com/danilofes/refactoring-toy-example.git refactoring-toy-example
    > RefactoringMiner -c refactoring-toy-example 36287f7c3b09eff78395267a3ac0d7da067863fd

The output would be:

    4 refactorings found in commit 36287f7c3b09eff78395267a3ac0d7da067863fd:
      Pull Up Attribute     private age : int from class org.animals.Labrador to class org.animals.Dog
      Pull Up Attribute     private age : int from class org.animals.Poodle to class org.animals.Dog
      Pull Up Method        public getAge() : int from class org.animals.Labrador to public getAge() : int from class org.animals.Dog
      Pull Up Method        public getAge() : int from class org.animals.Poodle to public getAge() : int from class org.animals.Dog

When you run Refactoring with `-a`, `-bc`, `-bt`, after all commits are analyzed, a result `csv` file which use semicolon `;` as delimiter will be generated in the repository directory.
